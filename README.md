# html-template-sh-linux
#### HTML Template maker, shell script, linux.

### Info
The script ***WILL*** delete the current "**index.html**" file in the directory that it is installed in!! You can choose between 2 Design templates, the first one has some elements and css, and the second one is a simple HTML file with just a head, body, and a h1 tag.

### Start It Up
To start the script run the following;
```sh
$ sudo chmod +x ./main.sh
$ sudo ./main.sh
# The output should be something like the following
  Title For The Webpage: #### Your title here
  Design Template (1-2): #### Design template here
# After that you have your new index.html file!
```
